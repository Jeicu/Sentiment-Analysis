Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
This old country lanes
When we did not know the answers

All you need to live fine to live fine
A little sunshine because she need it
A dose of rain far in the evening
The waves crash down and we feel them
Say here's to the night we steal them
And I be running cause I figured out
The more I slow down the less I get out
And if we fall let's be strong now
Moving along we don't mind we don't mind

Comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night
I'm awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I
Want something that's feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won't fight
No need to leave spend our whole lives
Another day in paradise

I'll be gone until November
And Going through the letters that I send her
And thinking about the moment that I met her
Well I'll be back in due time in due time
Touchdown throw off my own two shoes
Still the same city I'll be used to
And all the reckless things that we do
Keep us young they're good signs they're good signs
Take a little more if you need it

The tide pulls me in but it takes slow
Here's to the nights that we let go
And I'm hoping that they figure out

No fears and no problems

Lock Up The Rainbow,Chris Lago,"Ever Since I was a young kid, I wondered how it felt to be in love
Now the year's have gone by, I notice, that love is not enough
And she dreams of doing something so accidental,
that she could pass as the innocent, instead of the mental
And she dream, dream, dreams of letting go
Instead I hold on to my rope
So she said:
""Lock up the Rainbow, and make me something beautiful
Turn me into shadow, I'll be here, the lover too shallow
Lock up the Rainbow, and make me something beautiful
Turn me into shadow, I'll be here""
Ever since I listened to my cassette tape, I wondered if what they sung was true
I was listen to Thriller, wondering when I'd meet the real you
Now she dreams of doing something so accidental,

Instead I hold on to my rope

So baby, let's pretend we're weightless
Kiss the ground goodbye, takin' that jump

Living like there's no tomorrow

Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

Only the most high I put before you
I just waan fi love you not control you

Take off the safety aim at the heart
Insecurity may take us apart and I'm

I'm a savage, lil' hoe, what you wan' do?

I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)

Niggas gonna get it 'til the sun rise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit, but I love cash (ayy)
I'ma just get it and get it again
Come ups I split with my friends, ayy
Twenty's them twenty's them twinny twin twin
Tryna flip Ford to a Benz
I'ma get it, I'ma get it regardless
Bussin' jugs and used to trap out the college
Give me brain, I swear that bitch is a scholar
No snakes around me, only snake on my collar
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus to Christ
Better hope he believe in your life
Free my lil' nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
He fighting his demons to light
All my niggas be trapping, your niggas be rapping
They robbed you, you asking what happened

Livin' in the fast life
Momma said you never act right, Goddamn
Guess I'm a bad guy
But I'm on my grind like a halfpipe
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
'Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone
Fast flash like, my future's a tad bright
Because when they rent is due, and your Benz is new
And your old friends be resenting you
Like my women brown, and my Benjies blue
Shit is fucked up when they envy you

Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice
Only one of me, but there's plenty of you

This is where I am and it's a beautiful life
So don't let it slip by tonight

There would nobody be out there who could take my soul

She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it

And I be riding rims were my tires any thinner

Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's

Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow

Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout

Where do we go from here
How crazy to think
We may not speak next year

Where do we go
Where do we go from here

Try to control the wheel

And no paratute
No crystal ball
Is gonna save us save us
From this fall
No magic tricks
And no ten foot wall
Could ever save us
Save us, after all

Save us, save us

All the time we spent
To have this bitter end
That's not what I thought it would be
We made some fearless plans
Took bricks in our hands
Now we are looking at the debris

Where do we go from here

Could ever save us

Watch the summer somehow come into my own now
Displaced high above the ground now Clarity
it sorrounds searching but there's no sound

And no paratute
No crystal ball

Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt
Real niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' diss me, I'm suprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya'
See if I can paint for you the larger picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
